**Open-source project manager for small teams with low budget**

## üéÆ Demo

Try Namviek at one of our demo instances:
- üá∏üá¨ Singapore: [namviek-sing.vercel.app](https://namviek-sing.vercel.app)
- üá∫üá∏ Virginia: [namviek-vir.vercel.app](https://namviek-vir.vercel.app)

## üí∞ Cost Comparison

Here's how Namviek can help your team save on operational costs. The comparison below is based on a team of 13 members:

| Tool | Cost per User/Month | Annual Cost (13 members) |
|------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Jira | $12.80 | $1,996.80 |
| Trello | $10.00 | $1,560.00 |
| Monday.com | $9.00 | $1,404.00 |
| ClickUp | $10.00 | $1,560.00 |

**Namviek**, being a self-hosted solution, only requires a fixed hosting cost of **$10-15 per month** ($120-180 annually), regardless of team size. 

This means your team can save up to **90%** on operational costs compared to traditional solutions. As your team grows, the cost remains the same, making Namviek an increasingly cost-effective choice for expanding organizations.
